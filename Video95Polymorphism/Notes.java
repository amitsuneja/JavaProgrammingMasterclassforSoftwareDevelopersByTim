    1. Static/Compile-Time Polymorphism
    When the compiler resolves the polymorphism during the compilation of the program, then we call such
    polymorphism as compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism. Sometimes we also call it static binding.
    In Java, we can implement or achieve the compile-time/ static polymorphism with the help of Method Overloading.


    2. Dynamic/Run-Time Polymorphism
    Runtime or dynamic Polymorphism is the polymorphism which resolves dynamically at the runtime rather
    than compile-time is called. We can also call it as dynamic binding or Dynamic Method Dispatch.
    Since the method invocation is during runtime and not during compile-time, this type of polymorphism is
    called Runtime or dynamic polymorphism.

    We can achieve dynamic polymorphism in Java with the help of Method Overriding.
