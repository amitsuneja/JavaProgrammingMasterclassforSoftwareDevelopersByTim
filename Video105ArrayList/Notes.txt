The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.

The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different:



import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class
ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>(); // Create an ArrayList object





The important points about Java ArrayList class are:

Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.if multiple threads try to modify an ArrayList at the same time then the final result becomes not-deterministic because one thread might override the changes done by another thread.
Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
In ArrayList, manipulation is little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
