java class members  - The components of a class, such as its instance variables or methods are called the members of a class or class members. 
A class member is declared with an access modifier to specify how it is accessed by the other classes in Java. A Java class member can take any of the access modifiers, such as - public, protected, default and private.



Static keyword - Static keyword can be used with class, variable, method and block. 


Java Static members - (members means variables or methods)  belong to the class instead of a specific instance, this means if you make a member static, you can access it without object See example SimpleStaticExample.java

Static members are common for all the instances(objects) of the class but non-static members are separate for each instance of class

Java Static block - Static block is used for initializing the static variables.This block gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory. A class can have multiple Static blocks, which will execute in the same sequence in which they have been written into the program.See example MultipleStaticblocks.java


Java Static Variables - Static variable is common to all the instances (or objects) of the class because it is a class level variable. In other words you can say that only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for such variables only happens once when the class is loaded in the memory.
Few Important Points:
Static variables are also known as Class Variables.
Unlike non-static variables, such variables can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods.
example -  StaticVariablesCanBeAccessedDirectlyInStaticMethod.java
ecample - StaticVariablesAreSharedAmongAllTheInstancesOfClass.java


Java Static Methods - Static Methods can access class variables(static variables) without using object(instance) of the class, however non-static methods and non-static 
variables can only be accessed using objects. Static methods can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods.
example - StaticMethodMainIsAccessingStaticVariablesWithoutObject.java
example - StaticMethodAccessedDirectlyInStaticAndNonStaticMethod.java
Static methods can't be overridden.
Static methods cannot use this or super keywords.



Java Static Class - A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
Nested static class doesnâ€™t need reference of Outer class
A static class cannot access non-static members of the Outer class
example - StaticClassExample.java
